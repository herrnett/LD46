-----------------Version history of Lonely Year-----------------

Preface: This "game" was made over the course of three days for
Ludum Dare 46. Back when I wrote it I didn't care too much about
commenting, which in retrospect turned out to be stupid. 
I assume you already knew that (only nerds read documents such
as this one anyways), but just in case: Learn from my fail,
comment your code. I just looked into it for the first time
since LD46 to adjust the game volume and... well, I couldn't 
remember a thing. So in the end I had to go through every single
node to find the relevant tweens. No fun.

However: Since I changed something, I figured it'd be a good
idea to write a version history for future me and other nerds.

BEHOLD:

-----------------v1.0-----------------
-Initial version. Not much to say here.

-----------------v1.1-----------------
-Volume of bgm and sfx raised.
-Made dialogue start by itself after title screen.
-Didn't do any commenting. Next time. Probably.
